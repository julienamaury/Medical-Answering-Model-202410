        "1": "The seventh edition of First Aid for the USMLE Step 2 CK contains a revised and expanded database of clinical material that student authors and faculty have identified as high yield for boards review. The facts are organized according to subject matter, whether medical specialty (e.g., Cardiovascular, Renal) or high-yield topic (e.g., Ethics) in medicine. Each subject is then divided into smaller subsections of related facts. Individual facts are generally presented in a logical approach, from basic definitions and epidemiology to History/Physical Exam, Diagnosis, and Treatment. Lists, mnemonics, and tables are used when helpful in forming key associations.",
        "2": "The content is mostly useful for reviewing material already learned. This section is not ideal for learning complex or highly conceptual material for the first time. Black-and-white images appear throughout the text. In some cases, reference is made to the “clinical image” section at the end of Section 2, which contains full-color glossy plates of histology and patient pathology by topic. At the end of Section 2, we also feature a Rapid Review chapter of key facts and classic associations to cram a day or two before the exam.",

We also solicit recommendations of additional tools for study that may be useful in preparing for the examination, such as diagrams, charts, and computer-based tutorials (see How to Contribute, p. xv).",
        "6": "The entries in this section reﬂect student opinions of what is high yield. Owing to the diverse sources of material, no attempt has been made to trace or reference the origins of entries individually. We have regarded mnemonics as essentially in the public domain.

Reaction develops rapidly after antigen exposure as a result of preformed antibody. Examples include anaphylaxis, asthma, urticarial drug reactions, and local wheal and f are. First and Fast (anaphylaxis). Types I, II, and III are all antibody, or B-cell, mediated. Type II Cytotoxic: IgM and IgG bind to antigen on an “enemy” cell, leading to lysis (by complement) or phagocytosis. Examples include autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Rh disease (erythroblastosis fetalis), Goodpasture’s syndrome, and rheumatic fever. Cy-2-toxic. Antibody and complement lead to membrane attack complex (MAC). Type III Immune complex: Antigen-antibody complexes activate complement, which attracts neutrophils; neutrophils release lysosomal enzymes. Examples include polyarteritis nodosa, immune complex glomerulonephritis, SLE, and rheumatoid arthritis. Serum sickness: An immune complex disease (type III) in which antibodies to the foreign proteins are produced (takes f ve days). Immune complexes form and are deposited in membranes, where they fx complement (leading to tissue damage). More common than Arthus reaction. Arthus reaction: A local subacute antibody-mediated hypersensitivity (type III) reaction. Intradermal injection of antigen induces antibodies, which form antigen-antibody complexes in the skin. Characterized by edema, necrosis, and activation of complement. Examples include hypersensitivity pneumonitis and thermophilic actinomycetes. Imagine an immune complex as three things stuck together: antigen-antibody complement. Includes many glomerulonephritides and vasculitides. Most serum sickness is now caused by drugs (not serum)",

History/PE Presents with cyclical pelvic and/or rectal pain and dyspareunia (painful intercourse). Presents with the classic triad of noncyclical pain, menorrhagia, and an enlarged uterus. Diagnosis Requires direct visualization by laparoscopy or laparotomy. Classic lesions have a blue-black (“raspberry”) or dark brown (“powder-burned”) appearance. Ovaries may have endometriomas (the characteristic “chocolate cysts”). Ultrasound is useful but cannot distinguish between leiomyoma and adenomyosis. MRI can aid in diagnosis but is costly. Treatment Pharmacologic: Inhibit ovulation. Combination OCPs are frst line; other options include GnRH analogs (leuprolide) and danazol. Conservative surgical treatment: Excision, cauterization, or ablation of the lesions and lysis of adhesions. Twenty percent of patients can become pregnant subsequent to treatment. Defnitive surgical treatment: TAH/BSO +/– lysis of adhesions. Pharmacologic: Largely symptomatic relief. NSAIDs (frst line) plus OCPs or progestins. Conservative surgical treatment: Endometrial ablation or resection using hysteroscopy. Complete eradication of deep adenomyosis is diffcult and results in high treatment failure.
